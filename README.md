# reading-list
A reading list of relevant research papers on blockchains, P2P networks, and storage systems

## Why?
Cryptocurrency blockchains and decentralized systems built using them are marking a "second wave" of decentralized systems, where the first wave (2000-2005) was largely driven by advances in DHT and peer-to-peer systems. The problems that a lot of developers and researchers working on blockchain-based systems are trying to solve (like decentralized storage, decentralize DNS etc) were earlier investigated by a large number of researchers. It'd be unfortunate if the folks trying to build the new generation of such systems aren't aware of prior work and lessons learned.
